[References](https://opis.io/json-schema/2.x/references.html) is another great feature from
[opis/json-schema](https://opis.io/json-schema/2.x/).

With references, you are able to point to another JSON schema inside of schema. This can
be useful to reuse the same schema multiple times.

!!! tip
    Bear in mind that when referencing a schema the full prefix must be used e.g.
    *https://www.wp-fastendpoints.com/Posts/Get.json*
