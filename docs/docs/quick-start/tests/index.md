For testing our **WP-FastEndpoints** router we are going to use [pest/php](https://pestphp.com/).

Pest is a testing framework that makes it super easy to test functionality in PHP,
that's why we are going to use it here. However, if you have a preference for some other testing
framework, the some principles should apply ðŸ˜Š

## Testing dependencies

First, let's add all the necessary testing dependencies:

```bash
composer require mockery/mockery --dev  # For mocking classes/functions
composer require dingo-d/wp-pest --dev  # Adds Pest support for integration tests
```

## Testing structure

For testing our plugin, we are going to assume the following structure:

```
my-plugin
â”‚   my-plugin.php
â”‚   composer.json
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€src
â”‚       (...)
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€tests
    â”‚   bootstrap.php   # Loads WordPress for integration tests
    â”‚   Helpers.php     # (optional) Helper functions
    â”‚   Pest.php        # Pest configuration file
    â”‚
    â””â”€â”€â”€Integration
    â”‚       PostsApiTest.php
    â”‚
    â””â”€â”€â”€Unit
            PostsApiTest.php
```
