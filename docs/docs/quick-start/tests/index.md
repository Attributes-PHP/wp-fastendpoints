To test our router endpoints we are going to use [Pest PHP](https://pestphp.com/). Pest is a testing framework which makes PHP testing
a breeze. Besides, the creator of Pest is Portuguese and studied at the same university as me which is a bonus ðŸŒŸðŸ˜‚

However, if you have a preference for some other testing framework, the same principles apply

## Testing dependencies

To allow us mocking classes and function we will be using [Mockery](https://github.com/mockery/mockery)

```bash
composer require mockery/mockery --dev
```

## Testing structure

We are going to write unit and integration tests and our testing structure should look like the following:

```text
my-plugin
â”‚   (...)
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€src
â”‚       (...)
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€tests
    â”‚   bootstrap.php   # Loads WordPress for integration tests
    â”‚   Helpers.php     # (optional) Helper functions
    â”‚   Pest.php        # Pest configuration file
    â”‚
    â””â”€â”€â”€Integration
    â”‚   â”‚    PostsApiTest.php
    â”‚
    â””â”€â”€â”€Unit
        â”‚    PostsApiTest.php
```
