To better exemplify the benefits of using **FastEndpoints** we are going to build an API for manipulating blog posts.

This API will be able to:

* Create
* Retrieve
* Update and
* Delete a blog post

Full source code can be found at **[matapatos/wp-fastendpoints-my-plugin Â»](https://github.com/matapatos/wp-fastendpoints-my-plugin)**

## Plugin code structure ðŸ”¨

To hold this API we are going to create a plugin called *MyPLugin* - don't forget that logic shouldn't
be contained in a theme - with the following structure:

```text
my-plugin
â”‚   my-plugin.php  # Registers the plugin provider
â”‚   composer.json
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€src
â”‚   â”‚   constants.php
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€Api
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€Routers
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   Posts.php  # Holds our custom endpoints
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€Schemas
â”‚   â”‚       â”‚
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€â”€Posts
â”‚   â”‚           â”‚   CreateOrUpdate.json  # Validates request payload
â”‚   â”‚           â”‚   Get.json             # Validates responses and discards unwanted fields
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€Providers
â”‚       â”‚   ApiServiceProvider.php       # Registers all routers
â”‚       â”‚   MyPluginProvider.php         # Bootstraps our plugin
â”‚       â”‚   ProviderContract.php
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€tests
```
